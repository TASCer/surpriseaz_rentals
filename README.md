"HELPING KEEP HOA BOARDS IN THE KNOW AND COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES HONEST"

Provides rental parcel data for a Home Owners Association (HOA) community by accessing public data and presenting it in a timely and community member friendly 
and accessible manner.

Currently, the county assessor's office is the only entity providing a free API that I could find. 
    
POSSIBLE OTHER APIS:

    1 - Recorder's office would be a benefit.

    2 - Criminalality - crimometer/Google (7 day demo, pricing?), Crime Dats free

    3 - Community Vendors - Legal, Landscape, Collections

    4 - legal - https://legiscan.com/legiscan

Provides insights on:

- Community Rentals
    - Property Contact Information
    - Property Owner Information
    - Property Mapped Location

- Community Sales
